# sim_fmri_ma
The purpose of this project is to simulate an ecologically valid fmri meta-analysis.  

To be able to test meta-analytical tools and methods it is important to have a meta-analysis set that resembles a real meta-analysis in within- and between "study" variance but in the meantime does notÂ suffer from the same lack of data as fMRI meta-analyses. In this project we aim to develop such a meta-analysis set and test it's within- and between "study" variance and the influence of family ties on the variability.  

We use a meta-analysis on pain which can be downloaded from neurovault (http://neurovault.org/collections/1425/) (https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2016102). If the folder with the data is put into the working directory with the code, everything should work fine.  

## Done
* Read in t-maps  
* Compute effect sizes  
* Calculate within- and between study variance  
* Pool HCP studies
* Compute within- and between study variance of HCP meta-analysis

## To do
* Determine other parameters from both meta-analyses (number of peaks, clusters, peak heights, cluster sizes, sample size, ...)  
* Compare these parameters to the parameters of a meta-analysis constructed from HCP dataset
* Find new datasets (+ extract as many parameters as possible)
* Simulate new meta-analysis set based on these parameters
* Export different formats (t-maps, ES maps, SPM output, FSL output, peak coordinates)
