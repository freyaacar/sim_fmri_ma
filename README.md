# sim_fmri_ma
The purpose of this project is to simulate an ecologically valid fmri meta-analysis.  

To be able to test meta-analytical tools and methods it is important to have a meta-analysis set that resembles a real meta-analysis in within- and between "study" variance but in the meantime does not suffer from the same lack of data as fMRI meta-analyses. In this project we aim to develop such a meta-analysis set and test it's within- and between "study" variance and the influence of family ties on the variability.  

## Done
* Read in t-maps  
* Compute effect sizes  

## To do
* Calculate within- and between study variance  
* Determine other parameters (number of peaks, clusters, peak heights, cluster sizes, sample size, ...)  
* Find new datasets (+ extract as many parameters as possible)
